# copper-oxidation
Finding the optimal tessellation pattern for parallelepipeds, in order to more densely oxidize copper in minecraft.

find_sollutions.py is the main script

paralleliped.sc is a Scarpet script you can load in minecraft to render the tesselation in-game.

solutions.csv is all of the parallelepipeds created by the script, as matrices (each row is a vector).

angle_groups.json conatins the same solutions as solutions.csv, but grouped by the sets of angles formed between the three vectors

90-90-90.txt contains the solutions that happen to be cubes.
